Looking for job in context of india is easy

1. You should have a proper resume with all the information updated and you being able to descirbe all the details in it like a mantra should be the goal here.

2. Applying directly through Naukri/Instahyre/tophire etc. doesn't work very well of two reason 
    1. if the work is suitable you don't get enough exposre to what will be asked in the interview and what is expected out of you, ofcourse for the tech role this equation chnages as there are lots of website providing the same info
    2. You don't get clear picture on how the work will be like in the company
3. In Naukri keep your profile updated and the search will show you relevant Job opportunity, apply to them, don't wait for recruiter to approach you. go through the company on glassdoor and apply either on linkedin or through recruiter.

3. Best way according to me is Linkedin, follow these steps..
    1. Go to your connections list and see where are they working
    2. see if there is any opportunity availaible out there in the company for the desired role 
    3. ask for a referal and any possible connection who can guide you for the interview process.

4. Second way to leverage linkedin is :
    1. see if there is a job availaible in any of the company 
    2. Go to the people section and find relevant people, send them a connection request also asking for the referal.
    3. Try to connect with not to high/Not so low but some profile relevant to the profile you are looking for.

5. There are sites like indeed/Shine/Monster etc to look for job..

6. Refer to the general article webiste for article on job openings like
    1. AnalyticsVidhya
    2. analyticsindimag
    3. towardsdatascience
    etc

7. Never wait for applying for a job, company generally tend to recruit in batches so hiring process come and go. There may be a case where you will miss a hiring cycle of company and never get to hear from them despite having good chances of getting into.

8. A proper job switching process could take anywhere in b/w 1month to 2 month. Better if you have the current job offer with you and before accpeting any of the job offer ask for some time to put up your resignation. Do not accept any offer if you do not wish to join it.
    1. Of-course if you get better offer after accpeting that would be a different scenario.
9. There should be a proper balance in the amount of effort for finding good compnaies to apply and simultaneously to crack all these interviews.
If you have a interview schduled ahead of you prepare well for it, don't take it light.
10. Always ask for good amount of time from all the recruiter so that you can process all the information. Switching a lot of job won't be a very good case for you so decision you take should be final.
