Absolutely! Here's each behavioral story rewritten in the **STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to align with Meta's five success signals:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Resolving Conflict: PGVector vs. ChromaDB**
**S**ituation:  
Our chatbot project initially used ChromaDB for vector search, but it faced performance and reliability issues. I identified PGVector as a better solution, but our architect was hesitant to switch due to perceived cost and minimal feature differences.

**T**ask:  
Convince the team and decision-makers of the need to migrate to PGVector, despite the architectural resistance, to improve system accuracy and scale efficiently.

**A**ction:  
I conducted thorough research comparing leading vector databases‚Äîbenchmarked them, highlighted their retrieval accuracy, and prepared a clear presentation for the team. I also proposed a phased implementation plan to address cost concerns and gain early wins.

**R**esult:  
My manager approved the PGVector switch. The system‚Äôs performance and accuracy significantly improved, especially in advanced retrieval use cases. It also unlocked support for SQL-style queries and a better few-shot example management system, accelerating project maturity.

### üìà **2. Growing Continuously: Upskilling to Build the Right Agentic Stack**
**S**ituation:  
At project inception, we had a high-level vision for an "Ask Me Anything" agent, but little clarity on the technical implementation. I had limited exposure to agentic AI systems at the time.

**T**ask:  
Upskill rapidly and identify the most suitable architectures, tools, and best practices to develop a robust agentic chatbot aligned with the project‚Äôs goals.

**A**ction:  
I enrolled in courses by Andrew Ng and LangChain‚Äôs founder, learned MRKL, ReAct, Zero/Few-shot CoT prompting, and RAG pipelines. I collaborated with other teams working on similar agents, exchanging insights on sentence window retrieval and marginal relevance.

**R**esult:  
I became the technical lead for the architecture and brought cutting-edge techniques like sentence-level overlap retrieval and Auto-CoT prompting to our system. These significantly improved LLM response accuracy and enabled us to scale capabilities across different user needs.

### üå™Ô∏è **3. Embracing Ambiguity: Turning an Unstructured Idea into a Product**
**S**ituation:  
The initial project scope was vague‚Äî‚Äúa company-wide AI assistant for technical dashboards.‚Äù We had no set path, tools, or dataset, and priorities shifted frequently.

**T**ask:  
Turn the abstract idea into a working prototype, make architectural decisions under uncertainty, and create clarity and direction for the team.

**A**ction:  
I defined concrete goals for the chatbot, set up LangChain‚Äôs MRKL agent for early experiments, created a POC with ChromaDB and GPT embeddings, and later migrated parts of the system to a custom XML-based framework due to parsing and latency issues.

**R**esult:  
We successfully delivered an MVP demonstrating general queries and reasoning capabilities. This got buy-in from the CTO and was greenlit for continued development. The project thrived despite the high ambiguity and became one of JCI‚Äôs top tech initiatives.

### üèÅ **4. Driving Results: Delivering a Product with Real Business Impact**
**S**ituation:  
To justify ongoing R&D investment, our team needed to demonstrate tangible progress and real-world application for the chatbot system in a short timeframe.

**T**ask:  
Develop a functional prototype that could answer general questions and reason with site data to support energy efficiency decision-making.

**A**ction:  
I led the development of multiple components: vector search, few-shot sampling, prompt-injection detection, and a custom CoT-based XML agent. I also drove adoption of PGVector, built labeled training sets from user logs, and incorporated SME insights into the system.

**R**esult:  
The chatbot diagnosed energy inefficiencies based on 7 parameters and suggested actionable steps aligned with carbon goals. The system was used by internal users and demoed to external clients. It placed in the Top-6 of a 3,000+ submission tech challenge, confirming its value and scalability.

### üí¨ **5. Communicating Effectively: Cross-Team Alignment and Stakeholder Buy-In**
**S**ituation:  
Our project required input from multiple teams‚Äîengineering, SME support, product, and sales. Each had different goals, knowledge, and technical fluency.

**T**ask:  
Ensure smooth communication and alignment across stakeholders to gather knowledge, improve product quality, and secure strategic approvals.

**A**ction:  
I conducted regular 1:1s with SMEs to understand their reasoning processes, onboarded their insights into the knowledge base, and tailored presentations for technical vs. non-technical audiences. When pitching PGVector, I created a deck that spoke both to engineering concerns and business impact.

**R**esult:  
We gained buy-in from all key stakeholders. SME feedback helped refine the diagnostic logic, the engineering team adopted my vector DB suggestions, and the product team approved new features like GraphAI. Effective communication helped us scale from a prototype to an org-wide tool.
