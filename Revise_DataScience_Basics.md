# Ensemble learning 
Types Of Ensemble Methods
Ensemble Methods can be used for various reasons, mainly to:

```
Decrease Variance (Bagging)
Decrease Bias (Boosting)
Improve Predictions (Stacking)
```


## Good to have sample project

1. Recommendation Engine 
2. ANy NLP based project like covid one
2. map-reduce and hadoop basic knowledge 
3. basic knowledge of statistics and linear algebra
    1. Distribution : poisson, Gaussian etc
    2. Linear algebra : Eigen value calculations and concept
4. Usage of t-SNE, SVM, Bayes theorem, PCA for one problem. See for the Usage of SVM for feature selection in decision tree.
5. Usage of ROC(reciever operating characterstics) and PR curve in actual decision of good classifier.
6. Andrew Ng notes complete transcript along with slides.


Ensemble Methods can also be divided into two groups:

>Sequential Learners, where different models are generated sequentially and the mistakes of previous models are learned by their successors. This aims at exploiting the dependency between models by giving the mislabeled examples higher weights (e.g. AdaBoost).
Parallel Learners, where base models are generated in parallel. This exploits the independence between models by averaging out the mistakes (e.g. Random Forest).
Boosting in Ensemble Methods
Just as humans learn from their mistakes and try not to repeat them further in life, the Boosting algorithm tries to build a strong learner (predictive model) from the mistakes of several weaker models. You start by creating a model from the training data. Then, you create a second model from the previous one by trying to reduce the errors from the previous model. Models are added sequentially, each correcting its predecessor, until the training data is predicted perfectly or the maximum number of models have been added.

Boosting basically tries to reduce the bias error which arises when models are not able to identify relevant trends in the data. This happens by evaluating the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

Types of Boosting Algorithms
1. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
2. Gradient Tree Boosting
3. XGBoost

In this article, we will be focusing on the details of AdaBoost, which is perhaps the most popular boosting method.

>Here are some first-order suggestions: \
Are you predicting probabilities?\
    Do you need class labels? \
    Is the positive class more important? \
    Use Precision-Recall AUC \
    Are both classes important? \
    Use ROC AUC \
Do you need probabilities? \

Are you predicting class labels? \
Is the positive class more important? \
Are False Negatives and False Positives Equally Important? \
Use F1-Measure\
Are False Negatives More Important?\
Use F2-Measure\
Are False Positives More Important? \
Use F0.5-Measure \
Are both classes important? \
Do you have < 80%-90% Examples for the Majority Class? \
